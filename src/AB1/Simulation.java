/*
    ADDITIONAL QUESTIONS:
        1) What is Data Encapsulation?
            Data Encapsulation describes the concept of "encapsulating" data and functionality that logically belong
            together by for example having them in the same class (e.g. moving the Vector Math Functions into the
            Vector3 Class)

        2) What is Data Hiding?
            Data Hiding means, quite literally, that data is hidden. This is achieved by making fields private
            (e.g. the instance variables in Vector3 or Body)

        3) What is to the left of a method call?
            On the left is either
                - nothing (when the method is static and directly imported)
                - a class (when the method is static)
                - an object (when the method is not static)

            Object methods can only be called from an object and not from a static context!
